# Countsy

_Track anything. Count everything._

Countsy is a lightweight web app that lets you create and manage custom counters for anything you want ‚Äî habits, projects, inventory, goals, and more.

Whether you‚Äôre tracking water intake, completed tasks, or inventory stock, Countsy keeps your counts organized and accessible.

Built with **React**, **DaisyUI**, **Supabase**, and **Lucide**, Countsy offers a clean, fast, and mobile-friendly experience.

## ‚ú® Motivation

This project began as an experiment: take the most ubiquitous coding example ‚Äî a counter ‚Äî and build something full-featured and production-ready out of it. Along the way, I wanted to deepen my experience with **Supabase**, learn to implement modern **authentication flows**, and explore best practices in component design, state management, and database structure.

The idea was simple: prove that even a humble counter app can be thoughtful, elegant, and technically instructive.
